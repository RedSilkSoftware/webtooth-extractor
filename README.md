# WebTooth-Extractor
A cross-platform desktop tool to extract data from any webpage with predefined filters with one click.

##Supported platforms & Operating Systems
Generally only pure Qt classes and datatypes have been used, so this code should be runnable on all platforms that Qt supports. So far I can confirm the following platforms and OS to be tested:
* MSVC 2013 64bit, tested on Windows 8.1-x64

##Requirements
* Modern C++ compiler suite (CLANG >= 3.5, GCC >= 4.82, MSVC-2013)
* Qt 5.4.1 is recommended, older versions of v5 could run as well but are not confirmed as of now

##Manual
The manual for the WebTooth-Extractor is embedded in the application. Just press F1.

## Screenshot
Here a first screenshot of the program. More will follow. Feedback, testing and pull-requests are very welcome from :girl: and :boy:.
